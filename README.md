# Real-time-color-detection
Welcome to the Real-Time Color Detection project! This repository contains a Python implementation for detecting and tracking colors in real-time using a webcam and OpenCV. This project is a practical application of digital image processing techniques and demonstrates how to harness the power of computer vision for dynamic color detection.
