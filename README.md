# Real-time-color-detection
Welcome to the Real-Time Color Detection project! This repository contains a Python implementation for detecting and tracking colors in real-time using a webcam and OpenCV. This project is a practical application of digital image processing techniques and demonstrates how to harness the power of computer vision for dynamic color detection.



Overview:

This project utilizes OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision, to capture video frames from a webcam and apply color detection algorithms. The main goal is to identify and track specific colors in real-time, which can be useful for various applications such as object tracking, color-based filtering, and interactive user interfaces.

Features:

Real-Time Color Detection: Continuously capture video from the webcam and detect specified colors.
Customizable Color Range: Easily adjust the range of colors to be detected by modifying HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) thresholds.
Interactive GUI: Optional graphical user interface for easier color range adjustments and visualization (requires additional libraries).
Efficient Processing: Optimized for real-time performance using OpenCV's efficient image processing functions.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python package)
NumPy (numpy package)
(Optional) Tkinter for GUI features
